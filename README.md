The following experiments were performed with R (version 4.3.1).

•	Step0, install the packages used for the experiments using the "step0. list of R packages.R" script in R (version 4.3.1).

•	Step1, a decision tree classifier for DCB should be developed via the “classif.rpart” learner based on the CART algorithm using the "step1. train and test the decision tree model.R" script, with "input_data.csv" as input data, which will output the "learner.Rdata" file.

•	Step2, rank of feature importance should be run using the "step2. feature importance ranking.R" script, with "learner.Rdata" file.

•	Step3, the decision tree model should be visualized using the "step3. decision tree model visualization" script, with "learner.Rdata" file.
